```

## üß™ Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Custom URL List
Modify the test URLs in any lab to check your own websites:
```python
urls = [
    "https://your-website.com",
    "https://api.your-service.com/health",
    # Add more URLs...
]
```

### Exercise 2: Parameter Tuning
Experiment with different parameters:
- Change `max_workers` in threading/multiprocessing
- Adjust `max_concurrent` in asyncio
- Modify timeout values
- Try different batch sizes

### Exercise 3: Error Injection
Add deliberately failing URLs to test error handling:
```python
urls = [
    "https://httpbin.org/status/500",  # Server error
    "https://invalid-domain-xyz.com",  # DNS error
    "https://httpbin.org/delay/10",    # Timeout error
]
```

## üîç Key Insights

After completing the labs, you should understand:

1. **Threading is best for:**
   - I/O-bound tasks (file operations, network requests)
   - Moderate concurrency (10-100 tasks)
   - Shared state between tasks
   - Quick implementation and debugging

2. **Multiprocessing is best for:**
   - CPU-bound tasks (calculations, data processing)
   - True parallelism requirements
   - Independent tasks without shared state
   - Utilizing multiple CPU cores

3. **Asyncio is best for:**
   - High-concurrency I/O operations
   - Network programming and web servers
   - Event-driven applications
   - Thousands of concurrent tasks

4. **Sequential is best for:**
   - Single tasks or very few tasks
   - Debugging and development
   - Simple, straightforward processing
   - Low-latency requirements

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Import Errors:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Network Timeouts:**
   - Check internet connection
   - Increase timeout values in code
   - Use alternative test URLs

3. **Performance Variations:**
   - Network latency affects results
   - System load impacts benchmarks
   - Run multiple times for average results

4. **Memory Issues:**
   - Reduce concurrent task count
   - Use smaller test datasets
   - Monitor system resources

### Platform-Specific Notes:

**Windows:**
- Multiprocessing requires `if __name__ == "__main__":` guard
- Some features may have different performance characteristics

**macOS:**
- Default multiprocessing start method is 'spawn'
- Performance may vary on M1/M2 processors

**Linux:**
- Generally best performance for all paradigms
- Default multiprocessing start method is 'fork'

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **For better results:**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Use a stable internet connection
   - Run benchmarks multiple times
   - Consider system specifications

2. **Optimization techniques:**
   - Tune worker/concurrent counts
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Monitor memory usage

## üéì Next Steps

After completing Week 1:

1. **Review your results** and compare performance characteristics
2. **Experiment with different parameters** to see how they affect performance
